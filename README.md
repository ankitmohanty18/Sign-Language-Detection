# Sign-Language-Detection 

### The American Sign Language letter database of hand gestures represent a multi-class problem with 24 classes of letters (excluding J and Z which require motion).<br> The aim of the project is to accurately predict the letter being indicated by the hand using sign language. Here, I have used Sign Language MNIST dataset from Kaggle. It contains pixel values in CSV format and the respective letters for training purpose.
